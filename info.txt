TODO: remove symbol_mode=true, lots of code will be removed
TODO: remove std::vector from *.cc (reduce dependencies)
TODO: remove std::map from *.cc (reduce dependencies)
      maybe https://github.com/paulhodge/EASTL/blob/community/include/EASTL/map.h
TODO: remove new and delete -- or reduce it (hard, because map needs it,
  otherwise it would be easy to remove) 
TODO: use gcc-4.4 for MinGW Linux cross-compilation as well (now 4.2)
TODO: try to make it even smaller for pdfsizeopt by accepting .pnm.gz
      instead of .png
TODO: use C-style comparators for jbstablesort, to avoid template generation
