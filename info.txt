TODO: make pixInvert a single function, without rop.c and roplow.c
      all we need is from pixInvert: PIX_NOT(PIX_DST)
      pts2.png is a good input to test pixInvert.
TODO: make libpng and libz functions static (for better dead code removal)
TODO: fix bug: make the output the same for pts2.png and pts2i.png
      (indexed1)
TODO: remove unused global variables from all libraries
TODO: use gcc-4.4 for MinGW Linux cross-compilation as well (now 4.2)
TODO: try to make it even smaller for pdfsizeopt by accepting .pnm.gz
      instead of .png
TODO: remove calls to L_WARNING etc.

doc: test with curi.png, because pts2.png is too small for output_chunks_size > 0
doc: Stripping the mingw_lib/*.a files makes them unlinkable.
doc: not used C++ new, delete
doc: not used C++ STL sort
doc: not used C++ STL map
